Reliable shell interfaces for Python 3.7+

## Motivation

Everyone loves and hates their command line shell. Quoting is hard, commands are
terse, delimiters are weird, flags are inconsistent â€” everything is an
anachronism. But in many cases, it's what you need.

_shint_ is an experimental library for wrapping and abstracting away the
peculiarities of individual shell programs, exposing them as Python APIs that
accept standard Python data structures as inputs.
